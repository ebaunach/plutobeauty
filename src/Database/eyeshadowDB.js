Whether you're looking for a striking or glamorous look for night time, or something more subtle and natural for wearing during the day, there is a shade for everyone. They dry quickly, and depending on the depth of colour desired, can be blended in on application or left to dry before blending for a more vivid look. Layering is also possible, but however you choose to use these liquid eye shadows they won't gather in crow's feet or fine lines around the eyes. The inclusion of patented beta glucan also means they're perfect for sensitive eyes. Pale Almond is subtle, natural, and perfect for daytime wear, and compliments our Bronzed Hazel liquid eye shadow if a duo tone is desired.",

Apply them dry for soft, subtle color, or wet for more vibrant intensity.  Learn how you can use your favourite shade to make customized lip balm with our easy DIY Lip Balm recipe on our blog, The Well!About Shade Tones: Warm Shades (W) if you have yellow undertones in your skinCool Shades (C) if you have blue undertones in your skinNeutral Shades (N) to accent any skin tone or eye colorApplication Tips: Dip your shadow brush into the loose minerals and tap off any excess \npowder.  Gently stipple the minerals on your eye lids.   Make sure your \nskin is well hydrated so the minerals will adhere.  Try misting your \nskin with Pure Anada Marine Mineral Toner, prior to applying your \nmakeup.If your shadow is prone to creasing, make sure your lids are free \nfrom excess oils before applying shadow.  If the problem is persistant, \ntry priming your lids with Pure Anada Matte Minerals Finishing Powder or\n a coordinating Velvet Matte Shadow.\nDeep shades of loose mineral shadow can be used as eyeliner.  To \ncreate a soft dry line, dip an angled liner brush into the powder, tap \nit off and line your eyes.  Or to create a liquid liner, wet your brush \nand dip it into the powder.  The minerals will stick to the brush.  Make\n a paste on the back of your hand, or in the lid of the jar.  Apply to \nyour eyes!Ingredients: Mica,  Iron Oxides, Ultramarines, May contain: Titanium Dioxide",
